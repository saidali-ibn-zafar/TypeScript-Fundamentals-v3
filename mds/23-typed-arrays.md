## Typed Arrays

A tuple is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index.

Tuples are great because they allow each element in the array to be a known type of value.

To define a tuple, specify the type of each element in the array:

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialize correctly
ourTuple = [5, false, 'TypeScript'];
```

```ts
// define our tuple
let ourTuple: [number, boolean, string];

// initialized incorrectly which throws an error
ourTuple = [false, 'TypeScript', 5];
```

## Readonly Tuple

We can protect out tuples from changing, just an example if we use .push to our tuple, it would be changed. However if we add readonly then it is as we expectedüëç

```ts
// define our readonly tuple
const ourReadonlyTuple: readonly [number, boolean, string] = [5, true, 'The Real Coding God'];
// throws error as it is readonly.
ourReadonlyTuple.push('TypeScript');
```
