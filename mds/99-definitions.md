## What is TypeScript? 
- TypeScript is a programming language which can be used as an alternative to JS, now it is actually knows as a superset of the JS language meaning that it basically extends the language with `new features` and syntax so it do all the same things that JS can do but it also comes with `extra features` and a `new syntax` to boot as well, now browsers by `default` they do not understand typescript we then have to compile it down into JS in order for browsers to understand it...
   - Alternative to JS `(superset)`
   - Allows us to use `strict types`
   - Support `modern features` (arrow functions, let, const)
   - `Extra features` (generics, interfaces, tuples etc)

## What are Optional Properties?
- Optional properties are properties that can hold a `value` or be `undefined`.
  TypeScript there are a few ways to declare an optional object property.
    - We can use a `union`,
    - or use the question mark `(?)` symbol after the property name.

## What is Type Checking?
- Type checking in TypeScript is the process of verifying the types of `variables`, `function parameters`, and `expressions` at `compile-time` to ensure that the code follows the expected type rules.

## What are Static and Dynamic Type Systems?

- Static Type System:
  - Type checking is performed at `compile-time`
  - Requires `explicit type annotations` and `declarations`.
  - Types are checked `before` the code is executed.
  - Provides `compile-time safety` and catches type-related `errors before runtime`.
  - Examples of languages with `static` type systems include TypeScript, Java, C++, and C#.

- Dynamic Type System:
  - Type checking is performed `at` runtime.
  - Types are checked `during` program execution.
  - Type errors may occur `during` runtime.
  - Does `not` require explicit type annotations or declarations.
  - May have `looser type constraints` and allow `implicit type conversions`.
  - Examples of languages with `dynamic` type systems include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

## What are Structural and Nominal Type Systems?
  - An object or class has a name and some structure
  - In `Nominal Type Systems`, two types are the same if they have the same names
  - In `Structural Type Systems`,  two types are the same if they have the same structure.
