## Objects
We all know that `object` types are defined by: 
  - The `names` of the properties,
  - The `type` of those properties.

For instance, if we had the concept of `Iphone` like "White Iphone 14" with properties: 
  - `company`: the manifacturer - "Apple",
  - `model`: the particular product - "Iphone 14",
  - `color`: the "color of product" - "White".

In progress...
