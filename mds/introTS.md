### What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is an `open source`, typed `syntactic superset` of JavaScript.

```
// TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, which means that it adds optional static typing and other features to JavaScript. TypeScript is designed to improve the development experience and maintainability of large-scale JavaScript applications.
```

  - Compiles to readable JS.
  - Three parts: Language, Language Server and Compiler
  - Kind of like a fancy linter

- TypeScript is `increasingly popular`.
